	*
	*    * @ref G_UTIL_TIMEOUT Read initial timeout value, as specified in GOpen() via `--timeout` switch.

#ifdef G_USE_GCOMPOUND
	//! Transact multiple commands in a single, compound format.
	GCLIB_DLL_EXPORTED GReturn GCALL GCompound(GCon g, GCStringIn buffer);
	/*!<
	*  gclib's standard GCommand() call sends one single command per transaction.
	*  Compound commands separated by semicolons are broken up into individual command
	*  calls. This has a number of benefits, not least increased safety.
	*
	*  In rare cases, buffered modes of motion such as PVT, Linear Interpolation,
	*  Vector mode, and Contour mode, can benefit from sending multiple commands
	*  in a single transaction. GCompound() provides for this capability.
	*
	*  If the string in `buffer` is larger than the hardware or communication
	*  bus maximum write size, GCompound will break the buffer into multiple
	*  transactions. Maximum write sizes will be used for each transaction.
	*
	*  It is the user's responsibility to ensure the following.
	*  1. The motion characteristics require such packing. Only high bandwidth
	*     motion requires this function. Galil recommends using the standard
	*     GCommand(), or the even simpler GCmd(), for most buffering applications.
	*
	*  2. The commands used are "colon-response" commands only. I.E. no commands
	*     that return data. `PV`, `LI`, `VP`, and `CD` are the commands typically
	*     used by this function.
	*
	*  3. The controller's mode of motion segment buffer has sufficient space
	*     to accept all the commands sent by this function. Although any error (?)
	*     will result in function failure, commands following the error that are 
	*     packed in the buffer may still be executed, possibly generating more
	*     errors or incorrect motion profiles.
	*
	*  4. The commands are properly formatted, ranged, and will not result in a run-time error.
	*     Although any error (?) will result in function failure, commands following
	*     the error that are packed in the buffer may still be executed, possibly generating
	*     more errors or incorrect motion profiles.
	*
	*  \param g Connection's handle.
	*  \param buffer The user's command buffer as a null-terminated string.
	*   Commands must be separated by semicolons. **The last command must have
	*   a trailing semicolon**. Do not terminate with a carriage return. GCompound() 
	*   may send the buffer in chunks, depending on the hardware or communication
	*   bus maximum write size.
	*
	*  \return The success status or error code of the function. See gclib_errors.h for possible values.
	*
	*  \note GCompound() is not part of the standard gclib release. Contact Galil Applications for a special build, http://galil.com/contact.
